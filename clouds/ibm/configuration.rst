Configuration
-------------

Dasein Cloud expects the following provider context values to be
present:

-  endpoint
-  accountNumber
-  accessPublic
-  accessPrivate
-  cloudName
-  providerName
-  regionId

The endpoint is the URL for the IBM SmartCloud API:
https://www-147.ibm.com/computecloud/enterprise/api/rest/20100331

The accountNumber and accessPublic values should both be set to your
SmartCloud login ID (generally your email address). The accessPrivate
value is your password.

The cloudName is "SmartCloud Enterprise".

The providerName is "IBM".

The regionId is the ID for the region you are working with. For example,
41 is Raleigh.
