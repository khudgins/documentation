Capabilities
------------

The following represents the general mapping of Nimbula concepts to
Dasein Cloud concepts:

-  Instances -> VirtualMachine
-  Images -> MachineImage
-  Security Lists -> Firewalls
-  Vethernets -> VLAN
-  Storage Volumes -> Volumes

Networking
----------

Networking is where there's a big mismatch between what Nimbula can do
and what's done in Dasein Cloud support. The fact is that Dasein Cloud
supports a lot more than we have implemented, we just haven't
implemented it yet.
