This section provides information on using configuration management systems within the
Enstratius console.

The Enstratius console allows you to manage resources using three kinds of configuration
management systems: Chef, Puppet and the Enstratius Object Store.

**Chef**

Chef is a configuration management tool created by Opscode. Enstratius supports the three
current types of Chef servers:

* Hosted Chef (OHC)
* Open Source Chef (OSC)
* Private Chef (OPC)

Enstratius works with version 0.10.x of these.

**Puppet**

Puppet is a configuration management tool created by PuppetLabs. Enstratius *currently*
supports:

* Puppet Enterprise 2.5

We are evaluating the best way to add support for non-PE2.5 Puppet masters.
